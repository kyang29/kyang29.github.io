## Hello!

My name Kong, like *King Kong*.

I’m a Senior Software Engineer based here in Charlotte. Most of my days are spent working across the stack—lately with a lot of .NET, Angular, and React. I’ve also been really exploring the possibilities of AI and how I can best optimize it for my own personal workflows.

When I’m not staring at a screen, I’m usually busy with a few other things:

Music & Gear: I’m a total gear head. I own a horde of guitars and am willing to dabble in almost every instrument. It’s my favorite way to switch off the "code brain."

The Outdoors: I try to get out as much as possible, whether that’s fishing, hoops or pickleball.

Hobbies: I love thrifting for guitar and camera gear. I also collect a little bit of Pokemon!

Photography: I like to explore a lot of different camera gear to document life, trips, and everything in between.

Software development brings out the tinker-er/problem solver in me. I enjoy the "alway can do" motivation when it comes to software.
