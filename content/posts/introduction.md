Hi, I'm **Kong**! I'm around 30 years old, snowed in on a random Saturday, and I decided to start a blog.

### About Me

I grew up messing around with computers and phones. Since I learned to read, my dad would buy me computers and tech, believing it would bring me success in life, even though he had no clue what I would do with it. My parents were first-generation immigrants, and our family grew up extremely poor. Because of this, I always tried to maximize what little I had. Instead of buying a RuneScape membership, I followed countless tutorials to run my own private server. Instead of getting a new phone, I flashed custom Android ROMs to unlock new features.

Because of this exposure to tech, when it was time to go to college and pick a "big boy" major, I chose computer science. My reasoning was simple: "I like computers and phones." I didn't know exactly what I wanted to do, but I knew it involved tinkering with computers. Fast forward to today, and I am a Senior Software Consultant at a firm in Charlotte, working on new and unique projects. 

### *Why?*

One of the biggest challenges in college was the struggle with *direction*. I didn't know what was out there, only that I wanted to do *something*. Even when I figured out a goal, I would get stuck on how to get there. It took countless hours of research (there was no AI back then) to understand the landscape. I often wished for a resource to guide me.

As I've matured in my career and life, I see others walking similar paths and asking similar questions. As I listen, I notice common themes:
- What should I learn, and where should I invest my time to get where I need to be?
- How do I break into tech with the odds stacked against me?
- Am I cooked? Is AI killing my chances? 

I've decided to build this blog as a compilation of questions I've been asked about the field, with a sprinkle of my random life lessons and thoughts.

Hopefully, whoever stumbles upon this blog finds some value, whether tech or career-related.
