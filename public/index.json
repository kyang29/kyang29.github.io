I\u0026rsquo;m around 30 years old, snowed in on a random Saturday, and I decided to start a blog.\nAbout Me\r#\rI grew up messing around with computers and phones. Since I learned to read, my dad would buy me computers and tech, believing it would bring me success in life, even though he had no clue what I would do with it. My parents were first-generation immigrants, and our family grew up extremely poor. Because of this, I always tried to maximize what little I had. Instead of buying a RuneScape membership, I followed countless tutorials to run my own private server. Instead of getting a new phone, I flashed custom Android ROMs to unlock new features.\nBecause of this exposure to tech, when it was time to go to college and pick a \u0026ldquo;big boy\u0026rdquo; major, I chose computer science. My reasoning was simple: \u0026ldquo;I like computers and phones.\u0026rdquo; I didn\u0026rsquo;t know exactly what I wanted to do, but I knew it involved tinkering with computers. Fast forward to today, and I am a Senior Software Consultant at a firm in Charlotte, working on new and unique projects.\nWhy?\r#\rOne of the biggest challenges in college was the struggle with direction. I didn\u0026rsquo;t know what was out there, only that I wanted to do something. Even when I figured out a goal, I would get stuck on how to get there. It took countless hours of research (there was no AI back then) to understand the landscape. I often wished for a resource to guide me.\nAs I\u0026rsquo;ve matured in my career and life, I see others walking similar paths and asking similar questions. As I listen, I notice common themes:\nWhat should I learn, and where should I invest my time to get where I need to be? How do I break into tech with the odds stacked against me? Am I cooked? Is AI killing my chances? I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to build this blog as a compilation of questions I\u0026rsquo;ve been asked about the field, with a sprinkle of my random life lessons and thoughts.\nHopefully, whoever stumbles upon this blog finds some value, whether tech or career-related.\nIf we did all the things we are capable of doing, we would literally astound ourselves. -Thomas Edison\n","date":"31 January 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/introduction/","section":"Posts","summary":"This is my first post on my site","title":"Introduction","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"31 January 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/personal/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Personal","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"31 January 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"31 January 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"\rHello!\r#\rMy name Kong, like King Kong.\nI’m a Senior Software Engineer based here in Charlotte. Most of my days are spent working across the stack—lately with a lot of .NET, Angular, and React. I’ve also been really exploring the possibilities of AI and how I can best optimize it for my own personal workflows.\nWhen I’m not staring at a screen, I’m usually busy with a few other things:\nMusic \u0026amp; Gear: I’m a total gear head. I own a horde of guitars and am willing to dabble in almost every instrument. It’s my favorite way to switch off the \u0026ldquo;code brain.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Outdoors: I try to get out as much as possible, whether that’s fishing, hoops or pickleball.\nHobbies: I love thrifting for guitar and camera gear. I also collect a little bit of Pokemon!\nPhotography: I like to explore a lot of different camera gear to document life, trips, and everything in between.\nSoftware development brings out the tinker-er/problem solver in me. I enjoy the \u0026ldquo;alway can do\u0026rdquo; motivation when it comes to software.\n","date":"31 January 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"Welcome to Kong.io","summary":"","title":"Welcome to Kong.io","type":"page"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
